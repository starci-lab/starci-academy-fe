/**
 * BRANCH - `Tree`: the smallest branch there is. It draws ONE registry node.
 *
 * Anything needing more than one node is a named branch that nests these. That is the whole of the
 * assembly story: the registry describes a node, a branch describes how nodes stack.
 *
 * IT OWNS NO CLASS OF ITS OWN. Every class on the rendered node comes from the registry entry, so
 * there is no seam here for a caller or a maintainer to quietly adjust.
 *
 * INSPECTABILITY. The node carries `data-node` (which key drew it) and `data-why` (why the things
 * inside it sit that way). The reason travels into the DOM because the place a tree is wrong is
 * the place a reader is looking when they notice.
