/**
 * BRANCH - `PressableSurface`: the control around a node that opens something.
 *
 * IT DRAWS ITS OWN CONTROL AND PUTS THE KEY'S NODE INSIDE IT. The branch it replaces rendered
 * somebody else's key ON a button host, which is a caller choosing the element for a key - the one
 * decision CONTRACT-4 refuses, because two call sites of one key would then disagree about what
 * element it is. Here the button is this branch's own, and the arranged node underneath is
 * unchanged: the same key can be pressed on one screen and inert on the next.
 *
 * THE BEHAVIOUR LIVES WITH THE THING THAT BEHAVES. A cursor, a hover answer and a pressed state are
 * claims about reacting to a pointer, and the thing that reacts is the control that owns the
 * handler and the disabled state. Written into the entry instead, the table goes on drawing a
 * pointer over a node whose call site passed no handler at all, and nothing can tell it to stop.
 *
 * ONE GESTURE, ONE ANSWER. A surface whose content NAMES its destination answers hover on that name
 * - the label underlines like the link it stands for - and must not also dim: told twice, the
 * reader learns the whole row is the link and then that one line is. A surface with no such name
 * dims instead, because something has to answer.
