 * LEAF - `IconTile`: a glyph on a filled plate, for the one mark that leads a row.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS RATHER THAN A DIV AROUND AN ICON. The plate is a size, a radius and a soft fill
 * that have to agree with each other; a caller assembling them by hand agrees differently on the
 * next screen. Here it is one decision, made once.
 *
 * TONE IS A MEANING. The fill and its foreground travel together, so contrast is the theme's
 * problem rather than a guess made per screen.
