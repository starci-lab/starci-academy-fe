 * LEAF - `IconButton`: a control the bar has room for only as a glyph.
 *
 * `label` IS REQUIRED AND IS NOT DRAWN. A glyph alone is unreadable to a screen reader and
 * ambiguous to everyone else, so the name is mandatory and becomes the accessible name and the
 * tooltip. A control that could be nameless is a control somebody will ship nameless.
 *
 * IT IS A SEPARATE LEAF FROM `Button` because the two differ in what they owe: a button owes a
 * visible label, and this one owes an invisible one. Collapsing them would make the visible label
 * optional, which is the exact hole this file exists to close.
