 * LEAF - `Button`: the thing a reader presses.

 * and its real width is the width of its label. A skeleton drawn without one would be a different
 * size from the control it stands in for, and the row would jump the moment data landed.
 *
 * `disabled`, `isPending` AND `isLoading` ARE THREE DIFFERENT FACTS. `disabled` means the action is
 * unavailable before a press. `isPending` means this exact action is running and draws a spinner.
 * `isLoading` is the shared data-loading slot and draws the same skeleton state as every leaf.

 * offer rather than a lesser one, which a filled `secondary` does not.
