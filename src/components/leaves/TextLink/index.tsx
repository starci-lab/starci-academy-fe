 * LEAF - `TextLink`: words that change what is on screen without going anywhere.

 * "Sign up instead" does not navigate - it swaps the panel under the reader - so an `<a href>`
 * would lie to a screen reader, offer a middle-click that opens nothing, and put a URL in the
 * status bar that leads somewhere it will not go.
 *
 * IT LOOKS LIKE A LINK because to the reader it is the same gesture, and it is the smallest
 * possible target for a decision that is not the surface's main action.

 * "why this price?" beside "you save 4,250". Set a step larger than the fact it explains, the
 * question outranks the answer, which is the rank backwards.
