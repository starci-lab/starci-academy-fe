/**
 * LEAF - `SeeMoreLink`: the way out of a section, drawn at the end of its label line.
 *
 * A CLUSTER LEAF - words and a caret - because the caret is not decoration a caller may drop. It is
 * the only thing distinguishing this from the fact that would otherwise sit in the same place, and
 * a section header where a control and a count look alike is one a reader clicks by mistake.
 *
 * THE CARET MOVES, THE WORDS DO NOT. The slide answers "is this a link" before the pointer has
 * travelled anywhere, and it rides the caret rather than the label because a header whose words
 * shift on hover makes the row underneath jump.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A HEADING'S EQUAL. Semibold at the section label's own size, in the accent's soft
 * foreground rather than the accent itself: loud enough to be found on purpose, quiet enough that
 * it never wins the line it shares with the name of the section.
