/**
 * LEAF - `Divider`: the line that says two things above and below it are alternatives.
 *
 * THE LABEL IS THE POINT. A bare rule says "these are separate"; a rule reading OR says "pick one
 * or the other", which is the whole reason it sits between a set of shortcuts and a form. A
 * divider without a word is decoration, so the word is required here rather than optional.
 *
 * IT IS `role="separator"` AND THE WORD IS PART OF IT, so a screen reader announces the boundary
 * rather than reading a stray syllable between two groups of controls.
