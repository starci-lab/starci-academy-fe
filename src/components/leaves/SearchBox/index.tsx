/**
 * LEAF - `SearchBox`: the one field that lives in the bar.
 *
 * A CLUSTER LEAF - a glyph, a box and a keyboard hint - fixed everywhere and forever, so it owns
 * the seam between them.
 *
 * THE SHORTCUT IS SHOWN, not merely bound. A reader who does not know the key never presses it, so
 * printing it in the field is the only thing that makes the shortcut exist for anyone but its
 * author. It is drawn as a hint rather than a control, because it is a fact about the keyboard and
 * not a thing to click.
 *
 * IT IS UNCONTROLLED like every other box. Search runs on submit, and a field that re-rendered the
 * whole bar on each keystroke would repaint the navigation while somebody typed.
