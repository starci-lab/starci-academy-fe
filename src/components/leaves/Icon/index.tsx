 * LEAF - `Icon`: the picture a word needs when the word alone is slower to find.
 *
 * WHY A NAME AND NOT A COMPONENT. A caller passing `<FireIcon />` decides three things at the call
 * site - which library, which glyph, how big - and the first screen to answer them differently is
 * the screen where the streak stops looking like the streak. Here the caller names the MEANING and
 * this file owns the glyph.
 *
 * WHY THE SET IS CLOSED. Heroicons ships a large glyph catalogue, and a product that can reach all
 * of them has no iconography, it has a search box.
 * `icon.md` is the canonical feature-to-glyph table: read it before adding a meaning or choosing a
 * nearby glyph, and update it in the same change as this map.
 *
 * COLOUR IS NOT A PROP. The glyph draws in `currentColor`, so it inherits whatever `text-*` the
 * node above carries and can never disagree with the label beside it.
