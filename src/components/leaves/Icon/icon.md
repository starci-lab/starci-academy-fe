# feature to icon map

This file answers “which icon represents this feature?” Read it before adding or changing an
`IconName`. The table maps PRODUCT MEANINGS, not screens: when the same feature appears in
navigation, a card and an empty state, every placement reuses the same meaning and Heroicon.

The same table is mirrored in `.claude/fe/canon/patterns/icon.md`. A feature-to-glyph decision
changes both copies together: canon carries the cross-repository law, while this source copy stays
beside the code so an author or AI cannot miss it while choosing an icon.

Do not choose a glyph because it resembles the nearest existing one. A new feature either reuses
an existing product meaning deliberately or receives a unique row here and matching entries in
`IconName` and `GLYPHS`.

## Role table

| Placement role | Heroicons family | Rendered size | Use when |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `heading` | `@heroicons/react/24/outline` | `size-6` | The glyph introduces a heading or empty region |
| `leading` | `@heroicons/react/24/outline` | `size-5` | The glyph leads navigation, a row, field, switch or icon control |
| `chip` | `@heroicons/react/16/solid` | `size-4` | The glyph sits inside a compact chip or text action |

Role never changes the feature mapping. `course` remains `BookOpenIcon` in every placement; the
icon leaf selects the outline or micro drawing from the role.

## Feature mapping

| Meaning (`IconName`) | Product feature | Heroicon | Why this glyph owns the feature |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand` | Academy/learning identity | `AcademicCapIcon` | A graduation cap names education without borrowing the course-reading mark |
| `aiChatbot` | Global StarCi AI assistant and Code coach | Purpose-drawn `StarCiChatbotMark` | A speech silhouette containing code chevrons makes the assistant distinct from the generic talent sparkle and readable without a text label |
| `streak` | Learning streak | `FireIcon` | Fire is the established continuous-streak metaphor |
| `credit` | AI credit/quota | `BoltIcon` | A bolt reads as consumable AI power, distinct from rewards |
| `reward` | Rewards and gift points | `GiftIcon` | A gift names the thing received rather than its numeric balance |

| `complete` | Completed/successful state | `CheckCircleIcon` | A checked circle names completion across authentication, quests and progress without tying the glyph to one feature |
| `pending` | Incomplete/pending progress | `CircleIcon` | The unfinished state is the exact empty twin of completion: keep Heroicons' outer `CheckCircleIcon` path and remove only its inner check |
| `signIn` | Enter account/session | `ArrowRightOnRectangleIcon` | The arrow entering a boundary names session entry |
| `signUp` | Create an account | `UserPlusIcon` | A person with a plus names account creation |

## Selection procedure

Repeated metrics, goals, kind labels, streak captions and compact facts stay text-led when the
legacy reference is text-led. Do not decorate `Content`, a streak count or each goal with its
feature icon. Tiny inline glyphs are reserved for generic state or action meanings that are
actually present in the reference, such as complete, failed, close or disclosure. Navigation,
named entry points and large empty-region headings may retain their reference-backed feature icon.

1. Find the product feature in the mapping table.
2. Reuse its `IconName`; never import the listed Heroicon at the call site.
3. Choose `heading`, `leading` or `chip` from placement, not personal size preference.
4. If no feature matches, add one unique meaning and Heroicon to this table first.
5. Update `IconName` and `GLYPHS` in the same change. The parity test rejects drift and duplicate
   Heroicons across different meanings.
