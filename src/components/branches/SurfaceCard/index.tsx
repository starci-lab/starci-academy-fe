/**
 * BRANCH - `SurfaceCard`: a named section, and the surface its content sits on.
 *
 * THE NAME IS HELD OUTSIDE THE SURFACE, which is the one decision the whole shape turns on. A
 * section whose content is ITSELF a set of cards - resume tiles, course rows - would otherwise draw
 * a card inside a card, and two nested insets read as a mistake rather than as a hierarchy. Holding
 * the label above means `frameless` can drop the inner surface without the label going with it.
 *
 * THIS IS WHY BRANCHES EXIST. `Tree` draws ONE node; a section is three - the column, the label
 * line, the surface - and nothing in the registry stacks nodes. Assembly is a branch's whole job.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY CONTAIN, AND NOTHING ELSE: `Tree`, leaves, other branches. No markup of its own, no
 * class of its own. Every class on screen comes from a registry entry. That single sentence is
 * what stops a branch quietly becoming a second registry.
 *
 * THE END OF THE LABEL LINE HOLDS ONE THING OR NOTHING, and an action outranks a fact when both are
 * passed. They compete for the same place on purpose: a fact and a control that look alike, sitting
 * where each other would, is how a reader presses the count.
 *
 * `level` IS DECIDED HERE, ONCE. Three blocks each choosing a heading level by hand is how one of
 * them ends up different; the branch is the single place, now that contracts hold only classes.
