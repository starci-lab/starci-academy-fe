/**
 * COMPOSITE - `Field`: one labelled box, with its hint or its refusal underneath.
 *
 * The label, input and optional hint remain independently meaningful values. Their arrangement is
 * fixed here, which makes this a reusable composition rather than one intrinsic leaf value.
 *
 * WHY THE LABEL AND THE BOX ARE ONE COMPOSITE. They are tied by `htmlFor`, and a pair held together
 * by an id is a pair that breaks silently when somebody moves one of them. Keeping their fixed
 * arrangement here means there is no seam for a caller to get wrong.
 *
 * THE REVEAL BELONGS TO THE INPUT LEAF. Whether a password is showing is intrinsic control state,
 * not a fact about the product; the composite only supplies the resolved accessible names.
 *
 * `kind` IS THE WHOLE OF IT. Which keyboard a phone offers, whether a password manager fills the
 * box and what a browser autocompletes all follow from the type attribute, so the caller names the
 * KIND and this file maps all three at once.
