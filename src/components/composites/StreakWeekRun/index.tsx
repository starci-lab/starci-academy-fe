 * COMPOSITE - `StreakWeekRun`: the last seven days, as one run of columns.
 *
 * Seven independent `DayCell` values form one fixed reusable week arrangement. Fixed count and
 * fixed interior make the composition stable; they do not collapse seven values into one leaf.
 *
 * SEVEN IS THIS FILE'S FACT. A week has seven days whatever the payload returns, so the count is
 * stated once here and the resting run is the loaded one rather than a second shape kept in step.
 *
 * The named `streak-week-run` branch owns the seam between the seven cells. This composite closes
 * those slots so callers can provide dates but cannot rearrange the week.
