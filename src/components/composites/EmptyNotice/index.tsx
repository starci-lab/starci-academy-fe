/**
 * COMPOSITE - `EmptyNotice`: what a region says when it settled with nothing in it.
 *
 * A fixed composition, and the same one everywhere. An empty list, an empty feed and an empty rail all
 * say the same three things in the same order - a mark, a sentence, a way out - so this is written
 * once and every block that settles empty reaches for it. A block minting its own would differ
 * from its neighbours by accident rather than by decision.
 *
 * THE WAY OUT IS PART OF IT. An empty region that only apologises leaves the reader nowhere to go,
 * so the recovery action belongs to this leaf rather than to something a caller remembers to add.
 *
 * IT NEVER RESTS. An empty state IS a settled answer - the block picks a different tree while it
 * is still loading, and picks this one only once it knows.
