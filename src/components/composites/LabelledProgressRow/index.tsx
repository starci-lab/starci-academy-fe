/**
 * COMPOSITE - `LabelledProgressRow`: a name, how far along it is, and the bar that shows it.
 *
 * The title, figure and progress value remain independently meaningful. This component fixes their
 * reusable arrangement; fixed interior is not evidence that three values became one leaf.
 *
 * IT NAMES ITS SHAPE, NOT A DOMAIN, and that is the whole reason it is reusable. It was
 * `CourseProgressRow`, which was a lie the moment a weekly target needed the same three parts: a
 * leaf named for one caller either gets copied for the second or turns its own name into a
 * falsehood. What it fixes is the ARRANGEMENT - label, figure, bar - and every caller with those
 * three things belongs here.
 *
 * THE FIGURE SITS ON THE TITLE'S LINE, not under the bar. A reader scanning a column of these is
 * comparing figures, and a figure below its own bar is read after the bar rather than with it.
