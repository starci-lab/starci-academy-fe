/**
 * COMPOSITE - `StatRow`: one standing figure, as a glyph, its name and the number.
 *
 * The icon, label and figure keep independent meaning and loading behavior. This file fixes their
 * reusable arrangement; a fixed interior does not turn those values into one leaf.
 *
 * THE GLYPH LEADS because it identifies the row faster than the name does, and the name between
 * them takes the slack, because a long one must clip rather than push the figure off the end.
 *
 * THE NAME DOES NOT REST. It is copy the caller already holds, so shimmering it would hide a word
 * that is not waiting on anything and leave the row unnamed exactly while a reader is working out
 * what it is.
